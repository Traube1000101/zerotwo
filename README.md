This repository contains the source code for a small portfolio website focused on advancing my skills in web development.  
It utilizes HTML, SCSS and JavaScript and the [ztext.js](https://bennettfeely.com/ztext/) library.

Feel free to explore and take a closer look at this project by visiting [zerotwo.traube.xyz](https://zerotwo.traube.xyz/).
